# Breadcrumb Schema Generator
If you own a website, you're probably already familiar with search engine optimization (SEO) and how it can improve your site's visibility and ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs). One aspect of SEO that's often overlooked, but can be incredibly helpful for both search engines and users, is implementing a ***[Breadcrumb schema Generator](https://meetanshi.com/schema-generator/breadcrumb)***.

A breadcrumb schema is a form of structured data that appears in the form of a navigation trail or "breadcrumbs" at the top of a web page. It typically looks something like this:

Home > Category > Subcategory > Page

Each segment of the breadcrumb is a clickable link that allows users to easily navigate back to a previous page or category. Breadcrumbs also help search engines understand the hierarchy and structure of your site, making it easier for them to crawl and index your pages.

So how do you implement a breadcrumb schema on your site? One option is to use a breadcrumb schema generator. These tools can help you generate the code necessary to implement a breadcrumb schema on your site, even if you don't have any technical expertise.
